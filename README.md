### About this repo
This course provided by my University named introduction to structural programming, focusing on foundational concepts and techniques in computer programming. Through a series of assignments and problem-solving tasks, I gained proficiency in C programming language, learned how to apply various programming constructs effectively, and honed my problem-solving skills. i have created sperated folder for each item with problem sets with answer also.
